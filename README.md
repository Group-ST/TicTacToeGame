## TicTacToeGame

Test driven development was used to test this code using j-unit


Write Test Cases: We began by writing test cases for the checkWin(), reset(), and draw() methods.

Implement Code: We then implemented these methods to make the test cases pass.

Continuous Testing: We continually tested the code as we developed it to ensure it met the test criteria.

Refactoring: We made necessary code improvements while ensuring that existing tests continued to pass.

## The result of the test can be seen in screenshot 07
